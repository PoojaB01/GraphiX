# GraphiX

This is a web portal developed using React JS.


### Functionalities of the Project:
* Nodes are created by clicking on the screen.
* An edge (unweighted) can be created either by clicking on the ends of the edge or by entering its ends as input.
* The nodes can be dragged across the screen, and all edges reconfigure themselves according to new positions of the dragged vertices accordingly.
* Graph can also be given as input by entering number of verices, number of edges and the end of each edge.
* BFS, DFS and MST algortihms can be implemented on constructed graph or input graph, starting with the selected vertex. 

### Functionalities to be implemented:
* Adding weighted edges in the graph.

### To run the project:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PoojaB01/GraphiX.git
