This is a web portal developed using React JS.

### Functionalities of the Project:
* Nodes are created on click at the area assigned to draw the graph.
* Edges (unweighted) can be created either by giving input the vertices joining them or by clicking them.
* Graph can also be given as input with number of verices, edges and all edge pairs.
* Algorithms BFS, DFS, MST can be implemented on constructed graph or input graph, starting with the selected verted. 

### Functionalities to be implemented:
* Adding weighted edges in the graph.


### To run the project:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PoojaB01/GraphiX.git
